# GeoLocation [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.kotlinnlp/geolocation.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22com.kotlinnlp%22%20AND%20a:%22geolocation%22) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KotlinNLP/GeoLocation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KotlinNLP/GeoLocation)

GeoLocation is a Kotlin library designed to support the identification of geo-locations in a text.

GeoLocation is part of [KotlinNLP](http://kotlinnlp.com/ "KotlinNLP").


## Getting Started

### Import with Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kotlinnlp</groupId>
    <artifactId>geolocation</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.5</version>
</dependency>
```

### Dictionary model

Download a serialized a model of the `LocationsDictionary` 
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZX9xWmb4lADqcaDVmii4HN168Itf0Lmc).


### Note

All the cities of our model are taken from the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org "OpenStreetMap web site") 
database. If you need to go back to the original locations you can find a mapping between our ids and OSM ones 
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_zW5F1DG-f2YpHdP51BkxM6drUergC0C).


## The locations JSON line file

A JSON line file, with a location for each line. 

### Locations hierarchy

Locations have one of the following types, that are deduced from their ID:
* `city` (ID: "XXXX?????XXXX")
* `admin_area_1` (ID: "XXXX??XXX0000")
* `admin_area_2` (ID: "XXXXXX0000000")
* `country` (ID: "XXXX000000000")
* `continent` (ID: "X000000000000")
* `region` (ID: "0X00000000000")

("X" stands for a hex digit from 1 to F, "?" stands for "0" or "X")

They are distributed following this hierarchy:
```
continent     region
    |___________|
          |
       country
          |______________
          |              |
          |           admin_area_2
          |______________|
          |       |
          |   admin_area_1
          |_______|
          |
         city
```
Note: as shown in the graph, the `admin_area_1` and the `admin_area_2` are optional in the hierarchy of a lower level 
location.

### Location properties

Each location is represented by a list with 16 elements, each representing a property:

0.  `id`: String. The ID.
1.  `unlocode`: String, nullable. The United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations (UN/LOCODE).
2.  `iso-a2`: String, nullable. Defined only for type 'country'. The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the country.
3.  `sub-type`: String, nullable. Defined only for some locations of type 'country', 'admin_area_2', 'admin_area_1' and 
'city'. The sub-type (the type is deduced from the `id`).
4.  `name`: String, nullable. The main name.
5.  `name translations`: Object, nullable. Defined only for some locations of type 'country', 'admin_area_1' and 'city'. 
An object containing the name translations associated by ISO 639-1 language code.
6. `other names`: nullable. Defined only for some locations of type 'country', 'admin_area_2' and 'admin_area_1'. 
A list of other names.
7. `demonym`: String, nullable. Defined only for some locations of type 'country', 'admin_area_1'. 
Defined only 'West Bank' and 'Gaza Strip'). The demonym.
8. `lat`: Int, null for type 'region'. The latitude coordinate.
9. `lon`: Int, null for type 'region'. The longitude coordinate.
10. `borders`: List of String, nullable. Defined only for some locations of type 'country'. 
It contains a list of the adjacent countries ids.
11. `is capital`: Boolean, nullable. Defined only for type 'city'. Whether a city is the capital of its country.
12. `area`: Int, nullable. Defined only for type 'country'. The area of the country in km^2.
13. `population`: Int, nullable. Defined only for some locations of type 'country', 'admin_area_1' and 'city'. 
The population.
14. `languages`: List of String, nullable. Defined only for some locations of type 'country' and 'admin_area_1'. 
The ISO 639-1 codes of the languages spoken in the location.
15. `altDivisions`: List of List, nullable. Defined only for some locations of type 'city'. 
It is a list of alternative divisions, containing in turn `type` (String), `name` (String) and `level` (Int), in this 
order.

### Location ID

A string containing a number in hexadecimal format, composed by 13 digits divided in 6 groups, each representing a 
level of the locations hierarchy.

An example:
```
"52A30012F04DD"
 5   2   A3   00   12F  04DD
(1) (2)  (3)  (4)  (5)  (6)

```

Groups:
1. Continent (1 digit)
2. Region (1 digit)
3. Country (2 digits)
4. Admin Area 2 (2 digits)
5. Admin Area 1 (3 digits)
6. City (4 digits)

Note: in the example, the country related to that location has ID "52A3000000000" (it is enough to replace the sections 
of the lower levels with zeros).
